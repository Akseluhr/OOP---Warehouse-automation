# OOP---Warehouse-automation
This project was created in collaboration with Vilgot Holdar and Hampus Andersson during my b.sc. studies at Uppsala University. 

In the project we used .json for storage. The GUI was created in windows forms. 

The implementation is based on provided functional and non-functional requirements, as well as a class diagram. 

In order to run the program, some packages are might necessary to install on your computer. They are not provided here due to their file sizes.
